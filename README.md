# The Braunstein* Bot

A simple discord bot for running a modified Braunstein in your personal discord servers. 

**To be used with the custom kitbashed Braunstein game rules made by my group of friends.**

Rules can be found with this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DA0ucT1-UXk8tSg4Pc3BqjnZXElfJP20jOD3C0-gBqw/edit?usp=sharing

Feel free to copy the repo and host the bot for your own discord server. 

To run the bot simply type ```node .``` in the terminal.

## Goal with Program

- Run on a cheap Rapberry Pi so that it is running 24/7
